## **Lab Report 1**

This is cd by itself. It does not do anything because you I am not prompting the terminal to go into a directory. This is not an error.

![Image](Capture1.PNG)
This is cd with a directory as an argument. Here, cd changes the working directory to the argument, messages. This is not an error.

![Image](Capture2.PNG)
This is cd with a file as an argument. Since the argument is not a directory, the terminal prompts an error, saying that the argument is not a directory.

This is ls by itself. The working directory is the messages folder. Here, all the contents in the directory are listed on the terminal. This is not an error.

![Image](Capture4.PNG)
This is ls with a directory as an argument. The working directory is the lecture1 folder. Here, all the contents in the argument directory (messages) are listed on the terminal. This is not an error.

![Image](Capture5.PNG)
This is ls with a file as an argument. The argument is the ar-iq.txt file with the relative directory of messages/ar-iq.txt. As a result, that relative directory is listed out. This is not an error.

This is cat by itself. Since cat expects a file as an argument, the terminal just goes to the next line and waits for an argument. This is not an error.

![Image](Capture7.PNG)
This is cat with a directory as an argument. Since the argument is not a file, the terminal prompts an error, saying that the argument is a directory.

![Image](Capture8.PNG)
This is cat with a file as an argument. Since the argument is a file, the contents of the file is printed. So, the contents of en-us.txt is printed on the terminal as "Hello World!". This is not an error.
