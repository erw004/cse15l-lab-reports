# Lab Report 4 - Vim (Week 7)
---

### Step 4:
Keys Pressed: `<up><enter>` The `ssh erw004@ieng6.ucsd.edu` command, which lets me log into `ieng6`, was 1 up in the search history, so I used the up arrow once to access it and then pressed the enter key to run it.

### Step 5:
Keys Pressed: `<ctrl><r><g><enter>` I used `<ctrl><r><g>` to access the command `git clone git@github.com:erw004/lab7.git`, which clones my fork of the repo from my GitHub account using the `SSH` URL, since it includes the letter g. Then, I ran the command by pressing the enter key.

### Step 7:
Keys Pressed: `<up><up><up><enter><r><2><esc><:><w><q><enter>` The `vim ListExamples.java` command was 3rd in the search history, so I pressed the up arrow 3 times to access it and pressed the enter key to run it. Now, I can edit `ListExamples.java`. Since I was already at the right spot to edit the bug, I pressed the r key to replace the 1 of `index1` with 2 to change `index1` into `index2`, fixing the bug.
